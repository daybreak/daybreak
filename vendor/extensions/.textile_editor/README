= Textile Editor

Created by Jason Garber, September, 2008.  Based on the Textile Editor Helper plugin from WVU.

Textile Editor places a bar above the textarea when Textile is the current input filter.

== Installation

./script/extension install textile_editor

  -- OR --

1) Unpack/checkout/export the extension into vendor/extensions of your 
   project.

2) Run the extension update task.

  $ rake production radiant:extensions:textile_editor:update

3) Restart your server

== Compatible extensions:

* enkoder_tags - for adding enkoded email addresses

Installing the RedCloth 4 gem is highly recommended since the RedCloth 3 bundled with Radiant is so buggy.  On Radiant 0.7 or higher, just gem install RedCloth.  For Radiant 0.6.9, you'll need the redcloth4 extension as well as the gem.
