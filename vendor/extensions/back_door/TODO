== TO-DO list

- add an "expr" attribute to <r:ruby> tag, so it evaluates the expression but does not render the value.  For example:

  <r:ruby expr="@limit = 3" />

  is equal to

  <r:ruby> @limit = 3; "" </r:ruby>

- <tag>s inside <r:erb> tags with ruby loops don't expand multiple times
    - the solution is to first apply the ERB filter and then expand the result
    - seems that this is not possible with Radius
    - for more info refer to the <r:erb> and <r:expand> documentation

- improve security
    - setting the $SAFE variable does not seem useful
    - Maybe also add a simple YAML file with the list of users allowed to use the tags.

- implement extra tags like <r:case> and <r:each>
