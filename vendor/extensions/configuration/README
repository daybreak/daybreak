= Configuration

The configuration extensions allows you to configure Radiant through 
the Radiant interface. There isn't a configuration interface
available in the current Radiant version, which isn't much of a problem,
because the configuration could easily be altered through the console.

Unfortunately, some of my extensions allow my end-users to change some
configurations. Therefore I created this configuration interface.

= How to use

Just checkout from SVN in the vendor/extensions folder of your Radiant 
installation.

When enabled, this extension will add 'Configuration' tab to your Radiant.
This tab and the underlying page will only be visible for Administrators.
The underlying page displays all configuration keys and their values. The
values can easily be altered by the form.

= Know issues

- It is not possible to order the keys because of the 'key' column, 
	which is a reserved keyword in MySQL databases.
