  text " Fall campaign service projects are large enough, for example, that it can be useful to subdivide the event by group, location or subactivity.  Simply create several events sharing a common name followed by a colon and some differentiating fact or description.  This can help a visitor more easily identify the particular mini-event that interests him."
